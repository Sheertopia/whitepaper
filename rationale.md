**Gaming Problems:**&#x20;

Gaming has several problems that negatively affect the gaming experience for players and hinder their ability to financially benefit from their gaming. One of the major issues is the lack of transparency and equitable tokenomics in GameFi projects. This results in a majority of GameFi projects losing value significantly, often dropping at least 80% from their all-time highs. According to a report by DappRadar, 90% of GameFi projects have decreased in value from their all-time high due to poor tokenomics.

Another issue with gaming is the non-resaleable avatars and in-game items. Players spend a significant amount of money on these items, but they are unable to resell them, resulting in a wasted investment. According to a report by Newzoo, players spent over Â£72 billion on non-resaleable avatars and in-game items in 2019 alone.

Additionally, gaming is also criticised for being monopolised, greedy, and unfair to players. A majority of gamers do not make money in GameFi gaming, as the industry is dominated by a few major players who control the market. According to a report by the Entertainment Software Association, 80% of gamers do not make money in GameFi gaming.

Our solution aims to address these issues by creating a platform that is transparent, equitable, and offers players opportunities to monetise their gaming experiences through true ownership of in-game assets, collaboration with investors, and a fair tokenomics system. This will create a win-win situation for gamers and investors, making the gaming industry more efficient, fair, and profitable for all parties involved.

**Education problems:**&#x20;

* Overcrowded classrooms: Large class sizes hindering individual attention and effective learning experiences.
* Outdated curricula and teaching methods: Inadequate preparation for the evolving job market and modern-day challenges.
* Inequality and access: Disparities in education quality and resources, limiting opportunities for underprivileged students.
* Teacher shortages and quality: Insufficient qualified teachers, decreasing overall education quality and overburdening educators.
* Insufficient focus on soft skills and real-world applications: Traditional education prioritising academic achievement over essential soft skill development.
