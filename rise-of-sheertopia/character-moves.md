Lambo (Apollo), known as the ultimate champion in the game, has evolved with an arsenal of new and devastating abilities. His offensive capabilities now include the signature move "Gunfire Gambit," where he masterfully shoots with his high-caliber gun, delivering precise and damaging shots to his enemies. Additionally, Lambo showcases the innovative missile attack "Bionic Comet," launching a powerful projectile from a mechanism built into his arm, causing massive area damage.

His mastery over magic is evident in two of his other attacks. The first is an electric assault named "Volt Vortex," where he conjures and fires a bolt of electricity, capable of paralyzing and damaging his foes with its high voltage. The second magical attack, "Thunderclap," is even more awe-inspiring, as he summons and directs a fierce lightning strike, channeling the raw power of a storm against his enemies.

For defense, Lambo adopts a unique approach with "Ethereal Encasement," utilizing magic to create a protective shield. This innovative shield not only provides robust physical protection but also symbolizes a fusion of technology and sorcery, reflecting his adaptability and strategic depth.

This combination of high-tech weaponry, elemental magic, and an unbreakable defense makes Lambo (Apollo) a more versatile and formidable figure on the battlefield. His presence not only intimidates opponents but also offers a diverse range of tactical options for any player allied with him.
