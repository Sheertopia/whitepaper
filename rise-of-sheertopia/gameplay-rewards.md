# ðŸ’Ž Gameplay Rewards

* In this game, players can earn rewards by playing, which can be used to upgrade their NFT characters. These characters come in four different rarities, with the rarest ones being the most sought after and valuable. Players have two ways to upgrade their characters:
  1. By grinding the game and collecting rewards, players can upgrade their characters to a higher level of rarity. The more rewards they collect, the faster they can upgrade their characters.
  2. By purchasing NFT characters directly from the marketplace. This allows players to upgrade their characters at a faster rate and also provides an opportunity for NFT owners to take advantage of NFT sharing and potential appreciation in value. For example, only 200 diamond rarity NFTs will ever exist in the game. As the game's popularity grows, players can expect to see an increase in scarcity of these rare characters.
