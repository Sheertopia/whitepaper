In the darkest recesses of the Gen-S world, where hopelessness and malevolence fester, a sinister force casts its ominous shadow upon the land. Deimos, the very personification of evil, holds sway as a formidable and mighty Bear, governing the carnivorous Gen-S with an unrelenting iron grip.

Rumoured to have been created from a different Gen-S strain, Zeus Pepe is one of several Vigilantes that have formed to dissociate from the frustrating politics and class system that has become Sheertopia. While not actually a god or able to throw lightning bolts, Zeus Pepe believes he is and can and that his powers will return when the balance of power is sufficiently decentralised into the hands of all Sheertopians and not just the elite few. As such, his fight is for justice and decentralisation with no particular allegiance to anyone (though, at the moment, he certainly does not like Deimos very much).\

Another Vigilante in the fight for decentralisation, Spartan Doge thirsts for combat, even if it means sometimes the innocent will suffer. Is that fair? Ask Spartan Doge and he‚Äôd bring to question who really is innocent in this new and experimental world we call Sheertopia? Is it fair that he was blessed with the skeletal and muscular structure of famed Spartan King Leonidas, unable to find anyone in the land who can provide even a grade school level competition in a fight? No. Yet here we are and here we will remain until enough time has passed that a new champion of Sheertopia emerges or peace is found and warriors are no longer needed.
