# $GRASS Litepaper

## Sustainable In-Game Economy Centred on GRASS Token

Incorporating staking for GRASS with its launch on the BASE chain, the in-game economy will focus on driving long-term engagement through staking rewards, deflationary mechanics, and valuable use cases across Rise of Sheertopia and Gen-S Battleground. Here's the revamped plan:

## Core Tokenomics Overview

GRASS Token (In-Game Utility & Staking Token on BASE Chain):



## What's coming for Holders:



* Staking for Perks & Rewards: Holders can stake GRASS to earn token rewards (varying APYs), unlock in-game perks, and gain early access amongst other things.
* Wagering in Gen-S Battleground
* Esports & Tournament Prize Pools
* Access to Premium Features
* Deflationary Mechanism Implementations
* Additional perks and use cases to be released soon…

\


## Staking Model for GRASS

Staking Tiers & Rewards:



* To begin with there will be 3 tiers of staking available to $GRASS holders, which will be based on time. Increased time of staking, means increased rewards and perks.
* More staking opportunities & rewards will be unlocked in the future.

\


## In-Game Perks for Stakers:



* Discounts on Purchases
* Exclusive NFTs & Character Drops
* Priority Access to Tournaments
* Additional in-game perks will be coming as the game develops…

## Token Sinks (Mechanisms to Reduce GRASS Supply)

\


The team is working on multiple ways to create additional value for holding $GRASS as well as making the token deflationary. Here are some of the use cases coming in the future:

\


* Entry Fees for Special Events
* Wagering, Mini-Game Fees & Rewards
* Dynamic Prize Pools for Esports
* NFT Purchases & Upgrades
* Crafting & Customization
* Burn Mechanism
* More ways coming in the future…
