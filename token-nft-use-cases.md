# ðŸŸ  Token/NFT Use Cases

In-game currency: GRASS tokens serve as the primary in-game currency, enabling players to acquire virtual items, upgrade their character, gain access to premium content, and unlock extra gameplay features.

NFT Sharing: Our platform introduces a revolutionary NFT sharing service, enabling owners to loan their NFTs to skilled gamers. This collaboration allows gamers to utilize these NFTs to enhance gameplay and achieve higher levels. Prior to lending, both parties will agree on the distribution of rewards that the gamer will receive from the eventual sale of the NFT. By opting for this service, owners also agree to exclusively list the NFT for sale on our dedicated marketplace, ensuring a seamless and integrated experience.

Rewards and Incentives: Engaging in our game offers more than just entertainment. Players are rewarded for their dedication and skill through various means. By completing in-game challenges or reaching certain milestones, players earn GRASS tokens, our exclusive in-game currency. These tokens not only signify achievement but also hold value within our gaming ecosystem, enriching the overall gaming experience.
